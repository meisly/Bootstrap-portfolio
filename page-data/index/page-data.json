I was torn between Physics which I loved and which finally convinced me that Math was worth doing and Biology which was also super interesting.  </p>\n<h5>Time for a change</h5>\n<p>  I ended up choosing biology but after many years and a few degrees I started to get frustrated with the push to specialize.  I loved learning about lots of different things and wanted to be flexible enough to work on lots of different problems.  In order to do this I decided to switch paths and learn to program intending to do bioinformatics.  However, once I got started I fell in love with programming and building things with software and I decided to ditch research for software development.  And now here I am, still learning and building and loving every second of it.</p>\n<h5>The future</h5>\n<p>  Although it’s hard to tell what the future will bring I am excited. I love my math and cs classes and am well on the way to becoming a computer science geek.</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"facebook":{"appId":"..."}}},"bgDesktop":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5702295a86ec1ca6accd25239362f692/034af/hero-background.png"}},"bgTablet":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5702295a86ec1ca6accd25239362f692/25d04/hero-background.png"}},"bgMobile":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5702295a86ec1ca6accd25239362f692/bed57/hero-background.png"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
